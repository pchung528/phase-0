What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, and Maintenance. 

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal is to design my own professional website.  It will feature content such as work history, background, passions, past projects, blogs, etc.  

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is potential employers.  I will provide information about myself as an introduction to who I am.  I want my website to be an interactive resume. 

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I want the user to view my information, be able to contact me, and see my blog.  I want this information to be easy to read and understand. 

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

UX deals heavily with the emotions of the user.  Emotions are subjective by nature, so it is difficult to measure effectiveness.  UX is different from usability, which refers to the user-friendliness and efficiency of the interface.  

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

UX is all about how a person feels when interfacing with a system, whether it is through a website, web app, or desktop software.  Although it is difficult for a concrete evaluation of the effectiveness and return of a UX design using quantitative measures, it is very important because this is where psychology meets computers.  

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

There was no point in the challenge that I felt that the work became tedious.  Although I can see how the git work flow can become tedious, I think that I haven't done it enough for it to become overly repetitive yet.
