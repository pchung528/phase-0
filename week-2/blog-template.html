How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was a good experience to talk about the material with someone else rather than just reading it.  I can see how teamwork can be crucial because we were able to give and take good ideas.  

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Of course.  I think that wireframing is an absolutely essential part of the process.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We decided to go with a simple yet effective layout.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

Everything is new!
