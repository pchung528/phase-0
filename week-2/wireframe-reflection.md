What is a wireframe?

Wireframing is a part of the design process.  In this step, a rough sketch layout of the website is determined.

What are the benefits of wireframing?

It allows for the programmer to code while having a concrete idea of what the website will look like.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

Although I am not comfortable and do not understand the full extent I can personalize my webpage, I found it enjoyable to plan out what it could look like.  

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I went through many revisions and it took a while for me to formulate a simple plan for what my page will look like.  I experimented with where the best place would be for headers, links, pictures, etc.  Searching google and looking at other people's professional websites help me form my idea.  

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I ended up clicking on many of the links that were featured on the websites that were given to me.  Google has been very helpful in finding small definitions and quick tutorials.  

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I did not find parts of this challenge tedious because this was all very new for me.  However, I am starting to understand just how much planning and implementing is required to launch a simple website, and I feel a newfound appreciation for some of the well-made websites that I have visited in the past.
