## 1.1 Thinking About Time Reflection

During my research, I have studied the state of "flow" and the pomodoro 
technique.

Athletes and scholars alike have been chasing this elusive state of the 
perfect balance between boredom and anxiety. "Flow" is essentially a state 
of consciousness in which an individual can experience a task so deeply that
it becomes enjoyable and satisfying.  All-star athletes such as Kobe Bryant
and Michael Jordan have often spoken about getting in the zone, and the methods
and practices that they have utilized to get there.  Similarly, we, as future programmers, can learn to get into the zone as quickly and for as long as 
possible through practicing concentration, finding an engaging yet challenging
activity, purposefully getting rid of distractions, and outlining clear goals.

The pomodoro technique is an example of a time boxing technique based on 25 
minutes of concentration followed by a break to allow the mind to recover.  
This can prove to be an important strategy because it is an easy yet effective
method to prevent burning out quickly.  

I currently use my agenda as my main time management tool.  I believe that I 
have found methods for time management that work for me.  Many times in the 
past, I have found that I strive more with less accountability.  However, as I 
enter this intensive program, I understand that I will be entering uncharted
territory for the work that is given versus the time allotted to finish.  
During this time, I plan to implement a strict time box technique.  I 
understand that the goal of this class is the cover as much material as 
possible, but it is also just as important to keep in mind to rest.  


## 1.2 Command Line Reflection


1. A "shell" is a program that allows the user to access and utilize the 
operating system.  Bash is a type of Unix shell.

2. I think the most challenging aspect of these exercises was trying to grasp 
the idea of maneuvering through my computer using simple commands.  It was very
interesting to see base "skeleton" of the code to carry out basic actions such 
as moving a folder. 

3.  Yes, I was eventually able to use all the commands.  It was often confusing 
at the start, but slowly working through the example helped me understand the 
main points of each exercise. 

4.  I think that most of the ones that we learning in the crash course are the fundamentals.  Essentially, all the commands that are listed below are crucial 
to display or manipulate the kernel.  If i had to choose, i think pwd and, cd, 
and ls are most important because they allow the user to see what is going on 
directly.

5.  
+ pwd - print working directory, prints the folder or directory 
+ ls - list directory, lists the contents of the folder i am in
+ mv - move file
+ cd - change directory
+ ../ - goes to the parent directory (does the same as ..)
+ touch - make empty file (New-Item)
+ mkdir - command to make directory
+ less - page through the file (more)
+ rmdir - remove directory
+ rm - remove file 
+ help - allows me to access help files


## 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

create new repo: 
+git init

fork a repo: 
1. go to the repository you would like to fork

2. click "fork" button at the top right

3. link to Github username

clone a repo: 
1. check that you are in the right place by using pwd

2. find the URL of the forked repo and use: git clone PASTE_URL_HERE

3. enter username and password if necessary

 

I think the biggest struggle I experienced setting up git and Github was that 
I forget to create the pathway between the computer and Github.  Although it 
may be fairly obvious, it is very easy to overlook.  I also feel that I still 
have trouble with the syntax of utilizing git.
