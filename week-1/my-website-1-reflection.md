Describe what open source means.

It is the practice of sharing how a program was made and allowing others to 
customize parts of it as they please.  There are non-profit communities such 
as the Mozilla foundation, and for-profit communities such as Wordpress.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

A programmer is allowed to hold on to the original copyright or patent on 
the work that they worked on.  A license grants specific permission for others
 to use that work.  If a programmer chooses not to license, they can release 
 it into the public domain, where he/she relinquishes copyrights, and no one 
 is required to list him/her as an author or contributer.  The whole point of 
 open-source licensing is to make it easy for others to contribute without 
 having to seek special permission every time and receive some credit for 
 contribution to the project.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments?
What did you struggle with?

I feel that I am still a bit shaky on the whole process, but I did have some 
moments of clarity where I was able to make sense of process as a whole.  
Although I have limited knowledge on this topic right now, I am sure that I 
will be able to maneuver quickly with some more practice.
