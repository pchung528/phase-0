      What are the benefits of using version control?

      Developers use version control because it allows for the user to save different versions of their work as they go.  This is especially crucial when collaborating with others on the same master code.  Version control allows users full control through recording which part is modified, saved, and implemented.  It also records who contributed to the project, and allows the user to add a message about the changes that have been made.  Version control also offers a surefire method through which minimal mistakes will make it through to the master code.

      How does git help you keep track of changes?

      Git is a local version control software, which allows the user to save a history of different versions of the same work as you go on your computer.  Git even allows the user to pull in a partner's changes or push my own changes.  You can also write when, why, and what changes have been made the the code in an easy to read style.

      Why use Github to store your code?

      Github is a place to store working directories remotely, on the internet.  It is possible to store and access your work online and the different versions and revisions inside each work in progress through Github if you send it there(push).  Github is powerful due to its power as a collaboration tool.  It provides a way for many people to be working on the same code at the same time.
