<!--
What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was a great feeling.  I  liked that I could check on the progress of the site as I build it little by little.  

How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I found it to be fun and interesting, but felt that the html coding part was very tedious.  However, I think I can understand why it has to be that way. 

How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I tried my best to keep the spacing and tabbing as simple and as most readable as possible.

What seems good and bad about HTML?

As I mentioned earlier, I felt that many parts of html was tedious, but I can understand the purpose of making it that way.  The good part about html is that it is basically a blank piece of paper when starting.  I felt that it was very similar to art in that there is an unlimited amount of space for creativity.  

What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I don't think I have developed any tricks yet.  However, I try to close tags as I open one.
