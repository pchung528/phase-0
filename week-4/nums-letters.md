What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer does not feature a decimal point, while a float (floating-point number) always does.  

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Floats include the decimal point while integers do not.  For example, let us work with this division problem: 5.0/2.0 and 5/2.  In float division, the result will be represented by 2.5 while integer division will put out 2.  This difference is that when there is a remainder in integer division, it will automatically round down.  This can be helpful in situations such as when someone is trying to find how many books he can buy with a certain budget or figuring out how many groups of 5 a band can be split up into.
